The variable "j" holds a negative integer value of -3. The for loop operates until
the condition becomes false. The for loop contains a variable called "i" which holds
the value of 0. The "i<3" is a conditional statement that iterates until the statement
becomes false. If the conditional statement is still true, it runs the list of statements
within the for loop. The switch case is activated. The expression within the switch case's
parenthesis is evaluated. If it is met, then it searches for the matching case. Once the 
matching case is located, it executes the list of statements within that case.Afterwards, 
it exits the switchcase and then it goes to the for loop and iterates. 
Then the process starts again until the for loop's conditional statement is false or unmet.
